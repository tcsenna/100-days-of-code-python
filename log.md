# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: July 28, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Today I fixed Caesar Cypher Encryption/ Decryption code, as suggested by Angela Yu. My colleagues say that that attending to the first 10 days of this course means going back to basics and I agree. But reviewing is always good to build a stronger basis. \
I have rewritten my Caesar Cypher code to use only the concepts covered by Angela until now.

**Thoughts:** Easy topics but good to start up on this exciting 100 days journey.

**Today's Progress**: Still digging in the basics: Today I reviewed Python dictionaries and nesting.

**Thoughts** I enjoyed building a blind auction program.

### Day 10: July 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Still digging in the basics: Today I reviewed Python functions with returned values, recursion...
