# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: July 28, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Today I fixed Caesar Cypher Encryption/ Decryption code, as suggested by Angela Yu. My colleagues say that that attending to the first 10 days of this course means going back to basics and I agree. But reviewing is always good to build a stronger basis. \
I have rewritten my Caesar Cypher code to use only the concepts covered by Angela until now.

**Thoughts:** Easy topics but good to start up on this exciting 100 days journey.

### Day 12: August 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed Python Scope, LEGB rule, interesting insights on namescapes, etc.
I also started #30daysofML challenge, proposed by Kaggle.

**Thoughts**: I've built a "Guess the number" program.

### Day 13: August 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I started my deep dive into OOP. The instructor also gave important insights regarding debugging methodologies.

**Thoughts**: Learning many different tools. I am really enjoying my Python adventure.

### Day 14: August 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I keep studying OOP concepts. The bootcamp assignment for today was great to review all the basics that we have studied so far and to build a strong foundation.

**Thoughts**: I've built a "Higher Lower" game. Sometimes reviewing the basics and reading the documentation can be very boring, but without building a strong foundation, one can never become a great professional.

### Day 15: August 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I've had a hard time with many issues during the installation process of PyCharm and the latest version of Python. Maybe the problem is with my Linux Distro...and I've coded a coffee machine! =)

**Thoughts**: Interesting logic implementation but would be much easier if possible to use classes (not allowed in the actual stage of the bootcamp!). Enjoying Pycharm...I was uses to VSCode or Spyder or even Jupyter...
