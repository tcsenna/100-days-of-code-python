When outer() is executed, inner() and consequently the print functions are executed, which print the value the enclosed pi variable. The statement in line 10 looks for variable in local scope of inner, but does not find it there. Since pi is referred with the nonlocal keyword, it means that pi needs to be accessed from the outer function(i.e the outer scope). To summarize, the pi variable is not found in local scope, so the higher scopes are looked up. It is found in both enclosed and global scopes. But as per the LEGB hierarchy, the enclosed scope variable is considered even though we have one defined in the global scope.\n",
